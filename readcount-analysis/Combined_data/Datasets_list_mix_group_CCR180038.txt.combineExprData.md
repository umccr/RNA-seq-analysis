Script to combine gene-by-sample expression matrices from different datasets. It requires manually prepared dataset [file](./Combined_data/Datasets_list.txt) with four columns: 

	1. *Dataset_name* - user defined names of datasets
	2. *Expression_matrix* - corresponding expression/count matrices
	3. *Target_file* -  defining the sample names for merged expression matrix 
	4. *Outliers_file* - listing outlier samples to be removed before combining the data. 

Note, only genes intersection across all datasets expression matrices will be reported in the combined expression matrix. The pipeline is based on recommendaitons from *[RNAseq123](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/limmaWorkflow.html)* package.


### Define functions


```r
##### Create 'not in' operator
"%!in%" <- function(x,table) match(x,table, nomatch = 0) == 0

##### Prepare object to write into a file
prepare2write <- function (x) {
  
  x2write <- cbind(rownames(x), x)
  colnames(x2write) <- c("Gene",colnames(x))
  return(x2write)
}

##### Prepare gene data matrix to write into a file
geneMatrix2write <- function (x) {
  
  x2write <- cbind(rownames(x), x)
  colnames(x2write) <- c("Gene",colnames(x))
  return(x2write)
}

##### Assign colours to different groups
getTargetsColours <- function(targets) {
  
##### Predefined selection of colours for groups
targets.colours <- c("red","blue","green","darkgoldenrod","darkred","deepskyblue", "coral", "cornflowerblue", "chartreuse4", "bisque4", "chocolate3", "cadetblue3", "darkslategrey", "lightgoldenrod4", "mediumpurple4", "orangered3","indianred1","blueviolet","darkolivegreen4","darkgoldenrod4","firebrick3","deepskyblue4", "coral3", "dodgerblue1", "chartreuse3", "bisque3", "chocolate4", "cadetblue", "darkslategray4", "lightgoldenrod3", "mediumpurple3", "orangered1")
  
  f.targets <- factor(targets)
  vec.targets <- targets.colours[1:length(levels(f.targets))]
  targets.colour <- rep(0,length(f.targets))
  for(i in 1:length(f.targets))
    targets.colour[i] <- vec.targets[ f.targets[i]==levels(f.targets)]
  
  return( list(vec.targets, targets.colour) )
}

## Read in annotation and data files

Read in the ***dataset file*** containing inforamtion about the ***read count matrices*** to be combined along with the corresponding ***target*** and ***outliers*** files. Then merge the read count matrices based on the information in the *dataset file* Note that only genes intersection across all datasets expression matrices will be reported in the combined expression matrix. Genes not present across all datasets will be listed in *`[datasets`].missing_genes.txt* file.


```r
##### Read file with datasets information
DatasetInput=read.table(paste(params$projectDir,params$datasetsFile,sep="/"),sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE, row.names=1)

##### Extract info about target file for the first dataset
fileInfo = strsplit(DatasetInput[,"Target_file"], split='/', fixed=TRUE)
targetFile <- read.table(DatasetInput[1,"Target_file"], sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)[,c(1:4)]

##### Make sure that there are no duplciated samples in the target file
targetFile <- targetFile[!duplicated(targetFile[,"Sample_name"]),]
rownames(targetFile) <- targetFile[,"Sample_name"]
targetFile <- cbind(targetFile[,2:4],rownames(DatasetInput[1,]))
colnames(targetFile)[ncol(targetFile)] <- "Dataset"

if ( nrow(DatasetInput) > 1 ) {
  for ( i in 2:nrow(DatasetInput) ) {
    
    ##### Create a temporary object to store info from the remaining target files
    targetFileTmp <- read.table(DatasetInput[i,"Target_file"], sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)[,c(1:4)]
    
    ##### Make sure that there are no duplciated samples in the target file
    targetFileTmp <- targetFileTmp[!duplicated(targetFileTmp[,"Sample_name"]),]
    rownames(targetFileTmp) <- targetFileTmp[,"Sample_name"]
    targetFileTmp <- cbind(targetFileTmp[,2:4],rownames(DatasetInput[i,]))
    colnames(targetFileTmp)[ncol(targetFileTmp)] <- "Dataset"
    
    ##### Deal with replicates
    if ( any(!is.na(targetFile[,"Replicates"])) ) {
      maxRep <- max(targetFile[!is.na(targetFile[,"Replicates"]),"Replicates"])
      targetFileTmp[,"Replicates"] <- targetFileTmp[,"Replicates"] + maxRep
    }
    targetFile <- rbind(targetFile, targetFileTmp)
  }
}

##### Make syntactically valid names
rownames(targetFile) <- make.names(rownames(targetFile))

##### Loop through the gene-by-sample expression matrices from different datasets and merge them into a matrix
for (data_matrix in DatasetInput[ , "Expression_matrix" ] ) {
  
  ##### Create combined dataset variable if it doesn't exist yet
  if (!exists("datasets")) {
    datasets <- as.data.frame( read.table(data_matrix, header=TRUE, sep="\t", row.names=NULL) )
    
    ##### list genes present in individal files
    gene_list <- as.vector(datasets[,1])
    
    ##### Add data for the remaining samples   
  } else if (exists("datasets")) {
    dataset <-as.data.frame( read.table(data_matrix, header=TRUE, sep="\t", row.names=NULL) )
    
    ##### list genes present in individal files
    gene_list <- c( gene_list, as.vector(dataset[,1]) )
    
    ##### Merge the expression data and make sure that the genes order is the same
    datasets <- merge( datasets, dataset, by=1, all = FALSE, sort= TRUE)
    
    ##### Remove per-sample data for merged samples to free some memory
    rm(dataset)
  }
}

##### Use gene IDs as rownames
rownames(datasets) <- datasets[,1]
datasets <- datasets[, -1]

##### Make syntactically valid names
colnames(datasets) <- make.names(colnames(datasets))

##### Make sure that the target file contains info only about samples present in the data matrix
targetFile <- targetFile[ rownames(targetFile) %in% colnames(datasets),  ]

##### Make sure that the samples order in the data matrix is the same as in the target file 
datasets <- datasets[ , rownames(targetFile) ]

##### Save datasets names
datasetIDs <- rownames(DatasetInput)

##### Identify genes that were not present across all per-sampel files and were ommited in the merged matrix
gene_list <- unique(gene_list)
gene_list.missing <- gene_list[ gene_list %!in% rownames(datasets) ]


##### Write list of missing genes into a file
if ( length(gene_list.missing) > 0 ) {
  write.table(prepare2write(gene_list.missing), file = paste0(params$projectDir, "/", paste(datasetIDs, collapse="_"),".missing_genes.txt"), sep="\t", quote=FALSE, row.names=TRUE, append = FALSE )
}
```

## Remove outliers

Remove user-defined outliers from individual datasets listed in outliers files.


```r
outlierList <- NULL
j<-1

##### Read outliers file for each dataset and list them
for ( i in 1:length(datasetIDs) ) {
  
  ##### Check if the outliers file is reported. If not, assume that there are not outliers in the corresponding dataset
  if ( !is.empty(DatasetInput[ i, "Outliers_file"]) ) {
    
    ##### Check if the outliers file is not empty
    FileInfo = file.info(DatasetInput[ i, "Outliers_file"])
    
    ##### If non-empty then read it in
    if ( FileInfo$size != 0 ) {
      
      outliersInfo = read.table(DatasetInput[ i, "Outliers_file"], sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=FALSE, row.names=NULL)
      outliers=as.vector(unlist(outliersInfo))
      
      for (k in 1:length(outliers)) {
        
        cat(paste("Removing sample:", outliers[k], "\n", sep=" "))
        outlierList[j] <- outliers[k]
        j<-j+1
      }
    }
  }
}

##### Make syntactically valid names
outlierList <- make.names(outlierList)


##### Remove outliers from the combined expression matrix and target file
datasets <- datasets[, setdiff(colnames(datasets), outlierList) ]
targetFile <- targetFile[ setdiff(rownames(targetFile) , outlierList) ,]
```

## Datasets library size {.tabset}

### Datasets

Bar-plot illustrating library size for each sample (bar). The colours indicate datasets.


```r
suppressMessages(library(plotly))

##### Assigne colours to targets and datasets
targets.colour <- getTargetsColours(targetFile$Target)
datasets.colour <- getDatasetsColours(targetFile$Dataset)

##### Assign symbopls according to defined datasets
datasets.symbols <- getDatasetsSymbols(targetFile$Dataset)

##### Generate bar-plot for library size
##### Prepare data frame
datasets.df <- data.frame(targetFile$Dataset, colnames(datasets), as.numeric(colSums(datasets)*1e-6))
colnames(datasets.df) <- c("Dataset","Sample", "Library_size")

##### The default order will be alphabetized unless specified as below
datasets.df$Sample <- factor(datasets.df$Sample, levels = datasets.df[["Sample"]])

p <- plot_ly(datasets.df, x = ~Sample, y = ~Library_size, color = ~Dataset, type = 'bar', colors = datasets.colour[[1]], width = 1000, height = 400) %>%
  layout(title = "", xaxis = list( tickfont = list(size = 10), title = ""), yaxis = list(title = "Library size (millions)"), margin = list(l=50, r=50, b=150, t=50, pad=4), autosize = F, legend = list(orientation = 'v', y = 0.5), showlegend=TRUE)

### Targets

Bar-plot illustrating library size for each sample (bar). The colours indicate sample groups, as provided in *Target* column in the target files.


```r
##### Generate bar-plot for library size
##### Prepare data frame

colnames(datasets.df) <- c("Group","Sample", "Library_size")

##### The default order will be alphabetized unless specified as below
datasets.df$Sample <- factor(datasets.df$Sample, levels = datasets.df[["Sample"]])

## Data transformation and filtering

For differential expression and related analyses, gene expression is rarely considered at the level of raw counts since libraries sequenced at a greater depth will result in higher counts. Rather, it is common practice to transform raw counts onto a scale that accounts for such library size differences. Here we convert the read count data into log2-counts per million (***log-CPM***) using function from *[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)* package. Genes with very low counts across all libraries provide little evidence for differential expression. In the biological point of view, a gene must be expressed at some minimal level before it is likely to be translated into a protein or to be biologically important. In addition, the pronounced discretenes of these counts interferes with some of the statistical approximations that are used later in the pipeline. These genes should be filtered out prior to further analysis.


```r
##### Create EdgeR DGEList object
y <- DGEList(counts=datasets,  group=targetFile$Target)

##### Add datasets name for each sample
y$samples$dataset <- targetFile$Dataset

##### Filtering to remove low expressed genes. Users should filter with CPM rather than filtering on the counts directly, as the latter does not account for differences in library sizes between samples. Here we keep only genes that have CPM of 1
cat("The CPM of 1 (cut-off for removing low expressed genes) corresponds to", round(min(as.numeric(colSums(datasets)*1e-6)), digits=0), "reads in sample with the lowest sequencing depth, and", round(max(as.numeric(colSums(datasets)*1e-6)), digits=0), "reads in sample with the greatest sequencing depth\n")
```

```
The CPM of 1 (cut-off for removing low expressed genes) corresponds to 18 reads in sample with the lowest sequencing depth, and 86 reads in sample with the greatest sequencing depth
```

```r
keep <- rowSums(cpm(y)>1) >= ncol(datasets)/10
y.filtered <- y[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]

cat(nrow(y.filtered$counts), "genes remained after filtering out of the", nrow(datasets), "genes in the input read count matrix\n\n")
```

```
20366 genes remained after filtering out of the 52404 genes in the input read count matrix
```

```r
##### Transformations from the raw-scale to CPM. Add small offset to each observation to avoid taking log of zero
y.cpm <- cpm(y, normalized.lib.sizes=TRUE, log=TRUE, prior.count=0.25)
y.filtered.cpm <- cpm(y.filtered, normalized.lib.sizes=TRUE, log=TRUE, prior.count=0.25)
```

Show the data distribution before and after low expressed genes filtering.

## Data normalisation {.tabset}

During the sample preparation or sequencing process, external factors that are not of biological interest can affect the expression of individual samples. For example, samples processed in the first batch of an experiment can have higher expression overall when compared to samples processed in a second batch. It is assumed that all samples should have a similar range and distribution of expression values. Normalisation for sample-specific effectss is required to ensure that the expression distributions of each sample are similar across the entire experiment. Normalisation by the method of *[trimmed mean of M-values](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20196867) (TMM)* is performed using the *calcNormFactors* function in *[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)*. The normalisation factors calculated here are used as a scaling factor for the library sizes. TMM is the recommended for most RNA-Seq data where the majority (more than half) of the genes are believed not differentially expressed between any pair of the samples.

### Unnormalised vs normalised cpm data

Box-plots of log-cpm for individual samples, coloured by dataset, before and after TMM normalisation.


```r
##### Adjust for RNA composition effect. Calculate scaling factors for the library sizes with calcNormFactors function using trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) between each pair of samples. Note, that the raw read counts are used to calculate the normalisation factors
y.filtered.norm <- calcNormFactors(y.filtered, method = "TMM")

##### Transformations from the raw-scale to CPM
y.filtered.norm.cpm <- cpm(y.filtered.norm, normalized.lib.sizes=TRUE, log=TRUE, prior.count=0.25)

### Mean-difference plot

The performance of the *TMM* normalisation procedure can be examined using mean-difference
(MD) plots. This visualizes the *library size-adjusted log-fold change* between two libraries (the
difference) against the *average log-expression* across those libraries (the mean). Each MD
plot is generated by comparing one sample against an artificial library constructed from the average
of all other samples. Ideally, the bulk of genes should be centred at a log-fold change of zero. This indicates that
any composition bias between libraries has been successfully removed. The MD plots for all samples are saved in the *`[datasets`] MD_plots* directory.


```r
##### Generate MD plot for the random 2 samples in each dataset (or 1 if 2 not available)
par(mfrow=c(length(datasetIDs),2), mar=c(2, 5, 3, 2))

for (dataset in datasetIDs ) {
  
  ##### Get sample names for each dataset
  samples <- rownames(targetFile[ targetFile$Dataset == dataset, ])
  
  ##### Select random 2 samples (or 1 if 2 not available)
  if ( length(samples) >= 2 ) {
    samples <- samples[ sample(1:length(samples), 2, replace=FALSE) ]
  } else {
     samples <- samples[ sample(1:length(samples), length(samples), replace=FALSE) ]
  }
  
  for ( sample in samples ) {
  
    plotMD(y.filtered.norm.cpm, column=match(sample, colnames(y.filtered.norm.cpm)))
    abline(h=0, col="red", lty=2, lwd=2)
  }

}
invisible(dev.off())


##### Create directory for pdf files
MDplotsDir <- paste0(normalizePath(params$projectDir), "/", paste(datasetIDs, collapse="_"), "_MD_plots")

if ( !file.exists(MDplotsDir) ){
  dir.create(MDplotsDir, recursive=TRUE)
}

##### Save the plot as pdf file for each sample
for ( sample in colnames(y.filtered.norm.cpm) ) {

  pdf(paste0(MDplotsDir, "/", sample, "_MDplot.pdf"), width=6, height=5)
  plotMD(y.filtered.norm.cpm, column=match(sample, colnames(y.filtered.norm.cpm)), xlim=c(-10,15), ylim=c(-10,10))

## Exploratory data analysis {.tabset}

Before downstream analyses, we perform some exploratory data analysis such as PCA, relative log expression (RLE) plot, correlation matrix and scatter plot matrix. This procedure follows [this tutorial](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/print.php?id=202) and implements fucntions from the [inSilicoMerging](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages//2.10/bioc/vignettes/inSilicoMerging/inst/doc/inSilicoMerging.pdf) package.

### PCA plot (datasets)

Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset, making it possible to visually assess similarities and differences between samples and determine whether samples can be grouped. This exploratory analysis facilitates identification of the key factors affecting the variability in the  expression data. Different colours represent datasets.


```r
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
##### Keep only genes with variance > 0 across all samples
rsd <- apply(y.filtered.norm.cpm,1,sd)
y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset <- y.filtered.norm.cpm[rsd>0,]

##### Perform PCA
y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca <- prcomp(t(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset), scale=FALSE)

##### Get variance importance for all principal components
importance_pca <- summary(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca)$importance[2,]
importance_pca <- paste(round(100*importance_pca, 2), "%", sep="")
names(importance_pca) <- names(summary(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca)$importance[2,])
  
##### Prepare data frame
y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca.df <- data.frame(targetFile$Target,targetFile$Dataset, y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca$x[,"PC1"], y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca$x[,"PC2"], y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca$x[,"PC3"])
colnames(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca.df) <- c("Target", "Dataset", "PC1", "PC2", "PC3")

##### Generate PCA 2-D plot
p <- plot_ly(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca.df, x = ~PC1, y = ~PC2, color = ~Dataset, text=paste(targetFile$Dataset, rownames(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca.df), sep=": "), colors = datasets.colour[[1]], type='scatter', mode = "markers", marker = list(size=10, opacity = 0.7, symbol=datasets.symbols[[2]][order(targetFile$Dataset)]), width = 600, height = 400) %>%
layout(title = "", xaxis = list(title = paste( "PC1", " (",importance_pca["PC1"],")",sep="")), yaxis = list(title = paste( "PC2", " (",importance_pca["PC2"],")",sep="")), margin = list(l=50, r=50, b=50, t=20, pad=4), autosize = FALSE, showlegend = TRUE, legend = list(orientation = "v", y = 0.9))

The global variability of the data can also be assessed from the scree plot. Here, you can identify the fraction of total variance (y-axis) attributed to each PC (x-axis). The PCs are ordered by decreasing order of contribution to total variance. 


```r
##### Generate scree plot
##### Prepare data frame
y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df <- data.frame(paste0("PC ", c(1:length(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca$sdev))), y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_pca$sdev)
colnames(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df) <- c("PC", "Variances")

##### The default order will be alphabetized unless specified as below
y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df$PC <- factor(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df$PC, levels = y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df[["PC"]])

##### Generate scree plot
p <- plot_ly(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df, x = ~PC, y = ~Variances, type = 'bar', width = 600, height = 400) %>%
  layout(title = "The variances captured by principal components", xaxis = list(title = ""), margin = list(l=50, r=50, b=100, t=100, pad=4), autosize = F)

### PCA plot (targets)

Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset, making it possible to visually assess similarities and differences between samples and determine whether samples can be grouped. This exploratory analysis facilitates identification of the key factors affecting the variability in the  expression data. The colours indicate sample groups (e.g. biological groups), as provided in *Target* column in the target files.


```r
##### Generate PCA 2-D plot

The global variability of the data can also be assessed from the scree plot. Here, you can identify the fraction of total variance (y-axis) attributed to each PC (x-axis). The PCs are ordered by decreasing order of contribution to total variance. 


```r
##### Generate scree plot
p <- plot_ly(y.filtered.norm.cpm.subset_scree.df, x = ~PC, y = ~Variances, type = 'bar', width = 600, height = 400) %>%
  layout(title = "The variances captured by principal components", xaxis = list(title = ""), margin = list(l=50, r=50, b=100, t=100, pad=4), autosize = F)

p
```
